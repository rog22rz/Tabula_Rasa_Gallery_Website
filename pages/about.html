		<h1>what is almost art project?</h1>
		
		<p><span>AAP是中国首个也是唯一一个专为素人艺术家（自学，未受过专业艺术教育）举办的艺术项目。我们创办的素人艺术节自2015年至今已经成功举办了三届，发现并推出了百余位来自各个领域的素人艺术家，
		向公众展示千余件杰出的素人艺术作品。</span> <br>
		<span>我们拥有中国最大的素人艺术媒体平台，中国唯一持续记录素人艺术的文献类杂志《ART SU》。作为中国素人艺术的窗口，我们不仅积极推动各类素人艺术相关活动与合作，更在2018年前往纽约、日本参展，
		在日益重要的世界素人艺术版图中填补了中国的空白。</span></p>
		
		<p><span>Almost Art Project (AAP) is the first art festival in China that specializes in showcasing the works of outsider artists (self-taught artists 
		with no professional training). Since the inaugural exhibition in 2015, the annual event in Beijing has been held successfully in the past three years. 
		Over a hundred outsider artists of all backgrounds and ages have been discovered through the platform, and more than a thousand works of outsider art have 
		been shown at APP’s public exhibitions.</span> <br>

		<span>We have the largest outside art media platform in China and publish the only continuous yearbook on Chinese outside art, Art Su. As a window to 
		Chinese outside art, not only do we promote it through various public events and collaborations, we have also brought Chinese outside art to the US and 
		Japan in 2018, representing China in the increasingly important world map of outside art. </span></p>
